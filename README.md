** A platform to share information regarding what the “do’s and don’ts” of a particular judges courtroom are.**


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Context

When standing before a judge to address an issue, a well-crafted argument is key. However, judges are human. And a well-crafted argument may be impeded if the judge is unhappy with you or your client. CounterACT attempts to alleviate this issue by providing a platform to share information regarding what the rules, procedures, and “do’s and don’ts” of a particular judge's courtroom are.

## Motivation

Before programming I was a practicing attorney for 3 years. One thing I noticed during that time was that, often, you found yourself in front of a judge you knew nothing about. I would instantly think of the saying “a good lawyer knows the law, a better lawyer knows the judge.” Knowing how a judge conducts his courtroom is always valuable information to have, especially when you’re in an unfamiliar courtroom. I wanted to create a platform where a user could create an account, build a personal index of judges with information relevant to how those judges conduct their courtroom's. Users could then exchange this information with each other giving them data-driven insight into each judge.
